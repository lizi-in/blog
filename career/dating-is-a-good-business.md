# Dating is a good business

James is a serious man, respected Intellectuals and business elites, a good elder brother and teacher, one day, he said to me that "Ukraine ladies are pretty, you should go to date", I think he is not joking, then, I have the interest to research dating app's secret.

## Hire&Bot Dating

Dating online is becoming more and more popular today, many people want to make friends by dating apps. there are mainly two kinds of cheating tricks both in China and globally.

**Hire Dating:** the dating app company usually hires some real person to chat, they are might be both women and men, you never know who is sitting behind the screen, lots of single men are excited and would like to pay for a virtual girl of digital display.

**Bot Dating:** Less real employees, more profits, bots can help earn more money.  so, there are many bots created by internet companies.

Science&technology are developing quickly, AI's power is out of our imagination. you can not easily differentiate your chat partners are real persons or bots.

I used to test dating apps, and show my **personal descriptions** as:   
`This is a social engineering test, to research humans' behavior, dating bots tricks, user experience bugs. From: Asian boy, 166cm, 60kg, Athletic, Attractive, honest, silly.`

Since at least1950's, talented scientists had already known how to imitate human being's mentality and words, you must know the famous UK scientist Alan Turing  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan\_Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)

Film: Imitation Game [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)  
Turing test [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing\_test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)

> The Turing test requires that the machine be able to execute all human behaviours, regardless of whether they are intelligent. It even tests for behaviours that may not be considered intelligent at all, such as the susceptibility to insults,[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#cite_note-FOOTNOTESayginCicekli2002227%E2%80%93258-64) the temptation to [lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie) or, simply, a high frequency of [typing mistakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error). If a machine cannot imitate these unintelligent behaviours in detail it fails the test.

> To successfully appear human, there is no need for the machine to have any intelligence whatsoever and only a superficial resemblance to human behaviour is required.

After 70 year's development, AI is more powerful today, it's very cheap to deploy AI in the machine by a not high-level company, even many intelligent people are cheated by AI machines, most part of common people can not differentiate chat partners are bots or not. 



## Unhappy girl

The first day I login apps, I found a girl has only one picture in profile with an unhappy face, she is different, Most parts of girls' pictures are probably pretty and bright in apps. 

So I pay attention to her, click in and chat with her.  
  
For several times chats, I gained trust, then I got her blog, Instagram, other social account and even CV, I'm always warm-hearted, promise to help improving her career.  
  
From those documents, I get some conclusions as:

* Unhappy, Unhealthy;
* No job, Economic Dilemma;
* Confusion and chaos in life, Lack of clear goals and planning;

  
What’s more, from her words and pictures, I try to read her mind as:

* You seem don’t care about yourself or have no interest in human beings, because there are only a few human beings in your pictures.
* You have deep thoughts and insight into any tiny thing around the world. you want to express something.
* You might be in an unhappy and depressed mood sometimes, because there are more gray, dark, and thick colors in many pictures. Not much bright, light, warm and sunny color.
* Presenting regular geometric shapes and lines, means you follow the rules and logical spirit. You prefer the science and technology of the physical world rather than the pure art that is entirely based on feeling**.**

I know more stories about her that, every time she talks with her mom, she becomes sick, no mom could be so weird in this world, right? her mom is a witch? Not a witch, a bit of vampire probably? she laughed.

In my opinion, illness is probably not from the outside, but from inside more, ask your inner heart if there is something unusual, uncomfortable or depressed? maybe nobody can understand your ego and super-ego, conflict among ID, EGO, SUPER EGO.  
she read psychological books and know that Ego has to solve conflict between ID and super E, which may solve the problem by themselves.  
  
  
**My suggestion:**  
you can explore your inner power, self-review and consciousness by a tool - the **topographical model of the mind** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,\_ego\_and\_super-ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego)  
  
I can learn a lot while I help friends to explain their dilemmas with the above model.  
Eg. I talked with a friend about her English study. I give the key points to explain why her pronunciation\(speaking\) is relatively low level, while the other subjects\(reading, writing, listening\) are good, and how to improve from super-ego and ego, that’s the same study method for myself and for you also.  
  
I write many words. It's not only what I want somebody to hear, but to help myself to summarize my past part of life. How should I make a plan for personal development? what’s the better and easier path or approach to achieve success?  
So, thanks to everybody who has been willing to talk to me and tell each other’s stories, whether the stories are good or bad.

## **Psychological Healing** 

I want to share a famous Chinese Doctor Lin’s works with unhappy people. they are wonderful:

{% hint style="info" %}
Bright, warm, positive, inspiring, intelligent, humorous and funny 明亮、温暖、积极、励志、智慧、幽默、风趣
{% endhint %}

His words are more important than pictures, I think people are suffering a lot from the complex of society, family, personal development anywhere, especially in undeveloped countries, Literary and artistic works can heal people's hearts and activate passion or spirit.

### Anything serves politics

This part is hard to express in English, I speak in mother language.  
  
對於中國人而言，一切皆為政治服務，約會談對象也需要政治手腕，所以這里不得不提到這個刺眼的詞：  
  
我不是文藝圈的，我不知道具體情況，中國有拿得出手的現代文藝作品嗎？是根本沒有的，以我淺薄的見識理解，中國文化圈一直在吃老本（挖老祖宗的墳墓，講5000年的故事），拿傳統經典做文章，也快山窮水盡了。  
中國政府的大外宣，對外不斷進行帶有政治目的的文化滲透，也早已經被西方世界識破，所以官方辦的孔子學院難以繼續開展工作。  
  
小林漫畫是一個極其罕見優秀的例外，這需要智慧天賦和后天努力結合，我深信他的作品能同時贏得中國和西方的歡心，但是目前還沒有對西方進行傳播，僅僅在臨近的日本有過一次展覽，也許日本社會與中國非常類似吧，人們面臨許多類似的壓力。  
  
中國已經沒有什么拿得出手的軟實力文藝作品了，所以，我非常支持把小林漫畫往西方國家進行推廣，尤其是發展中國家，以及任何社會壓力較大的國家。  
  
中國大外宣，看起來贏了，成功洗了很多西方人的腦子，但是很失敗，它吹起的泡沫，將讓中國陷入窒息的絕境。  
  
英文媒體上極其少的關於小林漫畫的介紹，也都是通過CGTN之類官辦媒體傳播，請不必介意，可以當做一個簡單的參考。很遺憾，優秀的作品被保守在一個封閉環境中，還沒有更好更大的渠道對外傳播。  
[http://service.shanghai.gov.cn/sheninfo/specialdetail.aspx?Id=da52b0e0-d7c4-42bf-97b5-0ad9d5c883e2](http://service.shanghai.gov.cn/sheninfo/specialdetail.aspx?Id=da52b0e0-d7c4-42bf-97b5-0ad9d5c883e2)  
  
For the Chinese, everything is political, and political manoeuvring is needed for dating and family, so here I have to mention this stinging word.  
  
I'm not from the literary cultrue circle, I don't know the details. Is there any modern literary work in China that is worthy of mention? In my humble understanding, the Chinese cultural scene has been eating old money \(digging up the graves of the ancestors and telling stories from the past 5,000 years\), making use of traditional classics, and is running out of steam.  
  
The Chinese government's big outreach PROPAGANDA and constant cultural infiltration with political aims abroad has also long since been discovered and exposed by the Western world, so the officially run Confucius Institute is finding it difficult to continue its work.  
  
Xiaolin cartoons are a rare exception, requiring a combination of intellectual talent and hard work, and his work can won the hearts of both China and the West, but it has not yet been disseminated to the West and has only been exhibited once in nearby Japan, perhaps because Japanese society is very similar to that of China, where people face many similar pressures.  
  
China no longer has any significant soft power literature, so I am very much in favour of promoting Kobayashi's manga to the West, especially in developing countries, and any country where there is a lot of social pressure.  
  
The great Chinese foreign propaganda, which looks like a win and has managed to wash the brains of many Westerners, has failed miserably, and it has blown a bubble that will put China in a suffocating desperate situation.  
  
The extremely few presentations of Kobayashi's comics in the English media are also disseminated through government-run media like CGTN, so please don't mind them as a simple reference. It's a shame that good work is kept in a closed environment and that there are no better or bigger channels to disseminate it to the public yet.
