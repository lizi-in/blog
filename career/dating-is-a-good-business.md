# Dating is a good business

James is a serious man, respected Intellectuals and business elites, a good elder brother and teacher, one day, he said to me that "Ukraine ladies are pretty, you should go to date", I think he is not joking, then, I have the interest to research dating app's secret.

## Hire&Bot Dating

Dating online is becoming more and more popular today, many people want to make friends by dating apps. there are mainly two kinds of cheating tricks both in China and globally.

**Hire Dating:** the dating app company usually hires some real person to chat, they are might be both women and men, you never know who is sitting behind the screen, lots of single men are excited and would like to pay for a virtual girl of digital display.

**Bot Dating:** Less real employees, more profits, bots can help earn more money.  so, there are many bots created by internet companies.

Science&technology are developing quickly, AI's power is out of our imagination. you can not easily differentiate your chat partners are real persons or bots.

I used to test dating apps, and show my **personal descriptions** as:   
`This is a social engineering test, to research humans' behavior, dating bots tricks, user experience bugs. From: Asian boy, 166cm, 60kg, Athletic, Attractive, honest, silly.`

Since at least1950's, talented scientists had already known how to imitate human being's mentality and words, you must know the famous UK scientist Alan Turing  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan\_Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)

Film: Imitation Game [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)  
Turing test [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing\_test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)

> The Turing test requires that the machine be able to execute all human behaviours, regardless of whether they are intelligent. It even tests for behaviours that may not be considered intelligent at all, such as the susceptibility to insults,[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#cite_note-FOOTNOTESayginCicekli2002227%E2%80%93258-64) the temptation to [lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie) or, simply, a high frequency of [typing mistakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error). If a machine cannot imitate these unintelligent behaviours in detail it fails the test.

> To successfully appear human, there is no need for the machine to have any intelligence whatsoever and only a superficial resemblance to human behaviour is required.

After 70 year's development, AI is more powerful today, it's very cheap to deploy AI in the machine by a not high-level company, even many intelligent people are cheated by AI machines, most part of common people can not differentiate chat partners are bots or not. 



## Unhappy girl

The first day I login apps, I found a girl’s has only one picture in profile with an unhappy face, she is different, Most parts of girl’s pictures are probably pretty and bright in apps. 

So I pay attention to her, click in and chat with.  
  
For several times chats, I gained trust, then I got her blog, Instagram, other social account and even CV, I'm always warm-hearted, promise to help improving her carrere.  
  
From those documents, I get some conclusions as:

* Unhappy, Unhealthy;
* No job, Economic Dilemma;
* Confusion and chaos in life, Lack of clear goals and planning;

  
What’s more, from her words and pictures, I try to read her mind as:

* You seems don’t care about yourself or have no interest in human beings, because there are only a few human beings in your pictures.
* You have deep thoughts and insight to any tiny thing around the world. you want to express something.
* You might be in an unhappy and depressed mood sometimes, because there are more gray, dark, and thick colors in many pictures. Not much bright, light, warm and sunny color.
* Presenting regular geometric shapes and lines, means you follow the rules and logical spirit. You prefer the science and technology of the physical world rather than the pure art that is entirely based on feeling**.**

I know more story about her that, every time she talk with her mom, she become sick, no mom could be so weird in this world, right? her mom is a witch? Not a witch, a bit of vampire probably? she laughted.

In my opinion, illness is probably not from the outside, but from inside more, ask your inner heart if there is something unusual, uncomfortable or depressed? maybe nobody can understand your ego and super-ego, conflict among ID, EGO, SUPER EGO.  
she read psychological books and know that Ego have to solve conflict between ID and super E, that may solve the problem by themselves.  
  
  
**My suggestion:**  
you can explode your inner power, self-review and consciousness by a tool - **topographical model of the mind** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,\_ego\_and\_super-ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego)  
  
I can learn a lot while I help friends to explain their dilemmas with the above model.  
Eg. I talked with a friend about her English study. I give the key points to explain why her pronunciation\(speaking\) is relatively low level, while the other subjects\(reading, writing, listening\) are good, and how to improve from super-ego and ego, that’s the same study method for myself and for you also.  
  
I write many words. It's not only what I want somebody to hear, but to help myself to summarize my past part of life. How should I make a plan for personal development? what’s the better and easier path or approach to achieve success?  
So, thanks to everybody who has been willing to talk to me and tell each other’s stories, whether the stories are good or bad.
