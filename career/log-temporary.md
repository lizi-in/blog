**I plan to immigrate to other countries**

Yes, I read lots of immigration policies of the whole world, I only consider the OECD- developed country lists: US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Singapore, West & North Europe, they are probably English speaking countries.

If I stay in Ukraine for long-term residence, I should leave away from the local Chinese social circle, I had better immigrate to other powerful countries that can protect me.

that's why I should study English well

Not yet, if I talk about political, environmental and other publical issues, I will be arrested. The police warned me that they can find me even in other countries. 

How they can pay attention for more than 1 billion people, Even 5 millions ch citizens abroad. 

internet media control and monitor.



You will not like it in a humid and warm place, many people will have a musty smell and the whole person feels lethargic and not in good spirits. That's why the developed countries around the world are in the cold regions far from the earth's equator.

let's move to OECD countries, I explained in my English blog, see the above link

..the grass is always greener on the other side" - is about you

similar to the proverb, that other people's things are always good, other people's wives are always beautiful, and people are always feeling unsatisfied with themselves.

some people are satisfied with a specific environment, but some people get sick and even death. I'm a refugee that escaped from China in fact, because I love talking about the environment and public affairs, I worked as a volunteer for NGOs long time, its' very dangerous with all these political issues over there, some of my friends were arrested, I'm lucky and survived till now.







**Tips: how to write correctly?**

when I write a long blog in English for the first time, there are too many mistakes for grammar and vocabulary spelling, recommend a good tool for draft correction.

Updating ……



I don't want to waste our precious conversation fragments in daily life, make them useful, record them in the blog is easy for us. it's a part of our experience. Writing down carefully and then speaking with partners correctly.

by Tandem language community. I talk to the language exchange partners as follows:

## 2021.8.15 talk with James

James: How a person or a community responds and acts on a philosophical/moral/social principle does not necessarily reflect the true meaning of that principle. Each one of us would have to assess the principle ourselves and decide whether it fits with our own beliefs and morality. Certain elements of communism are unrealistically idealistic and it just fails when combined with the greed and ambitions of human beings. A similar thing can now also be said for the political system in the West. I believe it's not just the political system but the people who happen to occupy positions of power in a political system that really influences the outcome. No matter how multilayered or flexible a system is, it can be manipulated and perverted to serve the interest of a few. Democracy may have some additional tools to prevent that from happening but as you can see from Trump, it can also fail. The fundamental problem is a lack of respect for other human beings, no matter how different they are from us. If one loses this moral bearing, it doesn't really matter what political system we are in, we will be doomed.

Atom: your words must be above the band scores 8 in IELTS, I read carefully and make the record. in my experience, communism puts forward extremely high ideal goals and moral standards, but in reality is very hypocritical, unable to do even the basic things, but instead offers sharp criticism of others, in short, it's all the fault of others, typical psychopathy of giant babies, so most of the people in that community have this disease.

## 2021.7.15 **Why did I quit the language exchange app?**

There are at least 10 people saying hello to me when I log in tandem community first time. but most part of them just say hello and appear once a lifetime, they can not keep practice. Only a Russian student Sofya keep speak with me, the only one could speak for over 2 weeks.

no more than 1 month later after I install this app, I want to quit Tandem, I should shift to another instant messenger with Sofya, otherwise, I can not talk anymore, I told my opinion many times. about awaiting for 1-month later, finally, she agreed. she seems doesn't use mobile phone and app usually.

When I was hesitating and dilemma about which language would prefer. my language exchange partner Sofya is almost in the same situation.

Sofya wants to study Korean and has an interest in East Asia. after a short talk, She decides to think about it for 2 months, which one will be preferred.

My mother language is Chinese, I can speak English at the middle level and Japanese at the primary level.

I know more about East Asia, mainly including Japan, Korea, and China. if anybody has an interest in East Asia, I will definitely suggest Japan. so I suggest Japanese to my language partner.

**Why promote Japanese?**

**Japan’s culture:**

the most typical tradition and authentic cultural characteristics. it’s a new and old country with a long history.

Many people love to study Japanese, because of the famous Japanese animation movie and delicious food. I love all figures in Hayao Miyazaki' animation movie

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao\_Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki)

there are many pirated video copies in developing countries, they are poor and could not afford the Genuine version. there is a trial:

[https://ice.startmovie.site/movie/tt0096283/icc.html](https://ice.startmovie.site/movie/tt0096283/icc.html)

[https://thesmartlocal.com/japan/japanese-anime-movies/](https://thesmartlocal.com/japan/japanese-anime-movies/)

Frankly speaking, only Japanese animation movies could make me cry, I never cried before as a man. Japanese special culture deeply impacts me since I was a child.

**Japan’s progress:**

* Japan is more open, they study from the whole world. but China is too Conservative and old only old, not new;
* Japan is modern and advanced in science & technology, the most powerful and developed country in Asia;
* Japan could be one of the top 10 countries in the world;
* Japan is the only country list on G7 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group\_of\_Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven);
* Japan is the first Asian country listed in OECD;

Japan has little motherland on their island, so Japanese people immigrate to the whole world, Japanese passport is free visa to over 130 countries, really high-value passport. So it's not easy for too many people to immigrate to Japan, but you are welcome to travel and study over there.

## 2021.6.30 Why should I leave China and come here?

There was a language partner in Tandem ask me the above question, I answered as follows:



### Corruption Index Rank

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption\_Perceptions\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index)[https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl\#](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl#)

as you can see on the above links' map, the corrupt countries rank as below roughly: 

1. most undeveloped countries: parts of Africa /middle Asia/ North Korea 99% +
2. developing country: China  80% +; Russia/ Ukraine  60% +
3. most developed countries: OECD\( North&West Europe, North America\) Countries 10% -

I'm pretty sure, the corrupt level of China is higher than most undeveloped countries, the data rank is wrong, the above website may take bribes from China's government, so corruption is everywhere.

I have the experience since I was very young, I have many friends, relatives and family members who work for goverment and private company, I deeply understand that "No curruption, No bussiness in China", it means if you are not corrupted, you don't bribe your leaders, you can not do anything \(including do business, go to school, go to see the doctor, etc.\) in China, even you want to do a tiny job.



### Hong kong's Dynasty Gone

the legal, educational, economical system is more close to China's mainland since 1997, it will be worse, so we must leave and go far away to other countries.

 

### A brief introduction of myself

please call me Atom, I can send you my Chinese name in both English spelling and Chinese characters. I’m majoring in IT and E-commerce, I mainly work in the field of agriculture and food sectors, I'm experienced as a product manager and project operator in Alibaba and other top 3-5 Chinese companies of the industry. For more info please take my LinkedIn as a reference.



### How is the  business and next plan

A friend invites me to cooperate with him in Ukraine, so I come here, and run a new startup business.

Today I got my certificate of a **permit for employment of foreigners,** then I can get a **Residence permit for long-term staying in Ukraine,** so today is very important for me.

Although I can not recognize the Ukrainian characters. but I still found some bugs in the official documents,  my private information and credentials were used to register in the company without my permission in advance, so the negotiation is not enough sometimes between business partners. 

people can not have good communication, what's more, Chinese businessmen are always familiar with telling lies. it’s been a very common situation for a long long time, China is very conservative and too old, we close the door, and don’t communicate with the western world. we are too far away from civilization. so not only businessmen but also people in every aspect of every industry, they don’t follow the rules and destroy the contracts easily.

So I should leave China, go abroad, I feel good right now, it’s better than living in China. I want to stay here for the long term, but the Chinese business partners are always really terrible. So, I should consider what’s my solution for the next steps, how to solve this kind of problem? If I will lose my certificate of work and residence permit? what troubles will be in front of me?

Ukraine is a good country, but it's not good enough, it's still a developing country, and corruption is in governence and everywhere, the society is not fair. So I plan to stay here only 2-3 years, during the following years, we will expand the business to north America and West Europe. 

Thank you for your response and for sharing fresh local news.

## 2021.6.14 **Why did I use a language exchange app?**

I just arrived in Kyiv city of Ukraine a month ago, I decided to stay here for a temporary work about 2 years.

So I consider studying the local language, most parts of friends recommend Russian, it is more popular around the world. I think if we respect local people more, I should speak Ukrainian. but they think it’s doesn’t matter related to the National complex, only a few radical nationalists will angry when you speak Russian to them in Ukraine.

I don't know how to choose, Russian or Ukrainian? Those two kinds of language are very similar. I want to explore no more than 1 month to make the decision which one would prefer.

Anyway, I started the self-taught Ukrainian online for phonetic symbols and alphabets, 2 weeks later, I can read and spell simple words. I still can not talk freely with local people. I need lots of time to practice, then I decide to go to the language exchange app for help, a colleague suggests Tandem.

This is the first time I use tandem, which is similar to a social network app, many people just want to seek out friends. I am sure it is not a professional tool for language learners. I recommend two apps for you:
