# Dating is a good business in Ukraine

## Hire&Bot Dating

Dating online is becoming more and more popular today, many people want to make friends by dating apps. there are mainly two kinds of cheating tricks both in China and globally.

**Hire Dating:** the dating app company usually hires some real person to chat, they are might be both women and men, you never know who is sitting behind the screen, lots of single men are excited and would like to pay for a virtual girl of digital display.

**Bot Dating:** Less real employees, more profits, bots can help earn more money.  so, there are many bots created by internet companies.

Science&technology are developing quickly, AI's power is out of our imagination. you can not easily differentiate your chat partners are real persons or bots.

I used to test dating apps, and show my **personal descriptions** as:   
`This is a social engineering test, to research humans' behavior, dating bots tricks, user experience bugs. From: Asian boy, 166cm, 60kg, Athletic, Attractive, honest, silly.`

Since at least1950's, talented scientists had already known how to imitate human being's mentality and words, you must know the famous UK scientist Alan Turing  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan\_Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)

Film: Imitation Game [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)  
Turing test [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing\_test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)

> The Turing test requires that the machine be able to execute all human behaviours, regardless of whether they are intelligent. It even tests for behaviours that may not be considered intelligent at all, such as the susceptibility to insults,[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#cite_note-FOOTNOTESayginCicekli2002227%E2%80%93258-64) the temptation to [lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie) or, simply, a high frequency of [typing mistakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error). If a machine cannot imitate these unintelligent behaviours in detail it fails the test.

> To successfully appear human, there is no need for the machine to have any intelligence whatsoever and only a superficial resemblance to human behaviour is required.

After 70 year's development, AI is more powerful today, it's very cheap to deploy AI in the machine by a not high-level company, even many intelligent people are cheated by AI machines, most part of common people can not differentiate chat partners are bots or not.
